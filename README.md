Hola Amigo🖐Here, are some of my Data Science Prediction models clustered together ! Do check it out 🙏

## Questions arised in mind ?🤔
## What is KNN ?
## How does KNN work ?
## How do we choose the factor K ?
## When to use KNN ?

Well,I am upto resolve your queries rightaway!Come,on Let's do it 👍

KNN is basically Supervised machine learning for regression and classification .
Still Confused 💁‍♀️ ?

In data science K-Nearest Neighbors aka KNN is used to classify a data point based on how it's neighbors are classified.


Talking about it's working then let me tell you What it does is it simply learns from data sets and classifies new data points based on similarity or so called Nearest Neighbors.


To identify the nearest neighbors, KNN claculates the Euclidean Distance(the Euclidean distance between two points in Euclidean space is the length of a line segment between the two points. It can be calculated from the Cartesian coordinates of the points using the Pythagorean theorem, therefore occasionally being called the Pythagorean distance.)

How do you calculate Euclidean distance?


The Euclidean distance formula is used to find the distance between two points on a plane. This formula says the distance between two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is d = √[(x2 – x1)^2 + (y2 – y1)^2].

## For Example, Here x and y are attributes in datasets.So, maximum two attributes could be distance and higher dimensions . In graph we compare 3 types of flowers(setosa,versicolour,virginica). We can actually put the datapoint here and specify no. of neighbors we want to check against .Assume if k=5 we need to look for 5 nearest neighbors nearest to datapoint and check the maximum nearest flower neighbor characteristics satisfied.

## Choosing right factor K :- 
 
 👉 Choosing right K is known as 'Parameter Tuning'.
 
 👉 To avoid confusion Odd Value of K is selected foremost.

 ## When to use KNN(pros and cons) ?
 
 For Supervised Learning(Classification and Regression) with Labelled Dataset.

KNN can be used for small dataset because -> Computation of Euclidean distance is slow for large data set with a lot of variables.

It's Slow trainee -> As it doesn't actually learn from the train data set.Instead,it uses for training data itself for the purpose of classification of unknown data.

## Project Description ->

## Health care: Heart attack possibility
By Predicting the heart attack using dataset :- 

About data set

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to
this date.The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no/less chance of heart attack and 1 = more chance of heart attack.

## IRIS Flowers Classification ML Project
By predicting various features of the Flower like Sepal length and width ,petal length and petal width of the 3 different flowers (Setosa,Virginica,Versicolor) .


About data set 

This particular ML Project is usually referred to as the "Hello World" of Machine Learning.The IRIS flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms,mainly how to load and handle data.Also,since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.
