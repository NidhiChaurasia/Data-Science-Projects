Hola Amigo🖐Here, are some of my Data Science Prediction models clustered together ! Do check it out 🙏

## Questions arised in mind ?🤔
## What is KNN ?
## How does KNN work ?
## How do we choose the factor K ?
## When to use KNN ?

Well,I am upto resolve your queries rightaway!Come,on Let's do it 👍

KNN is basically Supervised machine learning for regression and classification .
Still Confused 💁‍♀️ ?

In data science K-Nearest Neighbors aka KNN is used to classify a data point based on how it's neighbors are classified .
Talking about it's working then let me tell you What it does is it simply learns from data sets and classifies new data points based on similarity or so called Nearest Neighbors.
To identify the nearest neighbors, KNN claculates the Euclidean Distance(the Euclidean distance between two points in Euclidean space is the length of a line segment between the two points. It can be calculated from the Cartesian coordinates of the points using the Pythagorean theorem, therefore occasionally being called the Pythagorean distance.)

How do you calculate Euclidean distance?
The Euclidean distance formula is used to find the distance between two points on a plane. This formula says the distance between two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is d = √[(x2 – x1)^2 + (y2 – y1)^2].
